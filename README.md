# Restaurant-Management-System
This is a simple restaurant management system. We can log in as an admin or a person from the restaurant. Then It will show us three option:
1. Display menu
2. Place order 
3. Exit
   
If we enter 1 it will show us the whole menu list of the restaurant.

If we enter 2 now, the admin can add the food the customer wants. Here the admin can enter order the food number that the customer ordered and the quantity of the food.
After taking the order if the customer does not want to add any more items now if the admin enters 0 then the system will show the total bill of the ordered food.
And all the order details with the total price will be saved in a file.

A demo of how actually the system works are given below-
